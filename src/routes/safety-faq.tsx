    category: "Invisible Grills Architecture",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What are invisible grills made of?",
        a: "SafeNest invisible grills use high-tensile AISI 316 marine-grade austenitic stainless steel wire rope (7x7 or 7x19 construction) wrapped in a transparent, UV-stabilized virgin Nylon-12 protective sheath. The cables are anchored into extruded 6063-T6 architectural aluminum tracks.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can invisible grills be breached or cut in a fire emergency?",
        a: "Yes. Unlike heavy fixed wrought iron grates that trap occupants and firefighters during building fires, SafeNest stainless steel cables can be severed in seconds using standard heavy-duty wire cutters for rapid emergency egress.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will the cables rust or turn yellow from tropical sun exposure?",
        a: "No. The combination of marine-grade 316 stainless steel and virgin UV-stabilized Nylon-12 prevents atmospheric pitting, corrosion, and UV discoloration under standard tropical weathering.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between 2-inch and 3-inch cable spacing?",
        a: "2-inch (50 mm) micro-spacing is recommended for households with infants, toddlers, or small pets to prevent heads or paws from slipping through. 3-inch (75 mm) spacing provides optimal fall protection for adult balconies and standard windows while maximizing open panoramic visibility.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Balcony & Safety Netting",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How long do HDPE safety nets last in open sunlight?",
        a: "Our safety nets are manufactured from 100% virgin High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) infused with carbon-black UV stabilizers, giving them an expected lifespan of 3 to 5+ years under continuous sun and monsoon exposure.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do balcony safety nets block fresh air circulation?",
        a: "No. The open diamond mesh geometry allows over 90% of natural airflow and ambient daylight to pass freely while maintaining secure perimeter containment.",
      },
      {
        q: "How are safety nets anchored into balcony ceilings and walls?",
        a: "Our installers drill into the concrete slab or masonry perimeter at 8-to-12 inch intervals to seat stainless steel anchor hooks. A reinforced perimeter wire rope is threaded through the mesh to maintain uniform, sag-free tension.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Survey, Installation & Warranty",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Is the initial on-site laser measurement complimentary?",
        a: "Yes. Our regional safety advisory team provides complimentary on-site digital laser measurements across all verified service hubs to inspect your structural substrate and calculate precise material requirements.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does standard residential installation take?",
        a: "Most residential balcony and window installations are completed within 4 to 8 hours by our trained installation team.",
      },
      {
        q: "What warranty coverage is provided upon handover?",
        a: "Invisible grill cable and track systems receive a 5-Year Material Warranty against manufacturing defects and corrosion. HDPE safety netting carries a 3 to 5-Year Material Warranty against UV degradation.",
      },
    ],
