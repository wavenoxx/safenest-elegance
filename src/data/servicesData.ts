    measurementProcess:
      "Our technicians perform precision digital laser measurements across all structural boundaries. We evaluate RCC wall density, balcony parapet alignment, railing load points, and structural clearances to fabricate custom-dimensioned aluminum tracks with uniform cable spacing (typically 2-inch for child protection or 3-inch for standard openings).",
    installationMethod:
      "Diamond-core drill bits are used to anchor the aluminum track profiles into RCC slabs or brickwork with heavy-duty stainless steel anchor fasteners. High-tensile cables are threaded continuously through precision nylon grommets and mechanically tensioned using calibrated dual-key locking mechanisms before final inspection handover.",
    maintenanceGuide:
      "Clean every 3 to 6 months using a soft microfiber cloth dampened with clean freshwater and mild neutral soap. Avoid abrasive scouring pads, hydrochloric acid, or harsh tile cleaners. For coastal residences, monthly freshwater wiping preserves the clear luster of the polymer sheath.",
